This project is intended to serve as a platform for research on philosophical video games and thus has no singular research question. A variety of research could be conducted by having participants play the game and potentially through modifications of game elements.


## Game Goals

 - Teach critical thinking (defined here as an ability to challenge the assumptions one lives by)
 - Teach normative ethics
 - Encourage philosophical thought
 - Instill an appreciation for philosophy

(#todo revise these after re-reading the Transformational Framework book)

## Thoughts on Metrics

The simplest metric to track would be "amount of normative ethics learned" which could use a simple multiple choice quiz. I dislike this for two reasons, firstly it isn't the most important transformation I am trying to induce, and secondly because the free flowing nature of the game means that players may see certain paths and miss others, an intentional choice which nonetheless means that players may score badly on a quiz through no fault of their own.

I'm specifically interested in metrics that track whether participants have gained critical thinking skills or an appreciation for philosophy (basically my game goals), but that is likely far harder to do.

## Effects of game elements

What are the effects of the following on the game goals:

 - Narrative
 - Dask (The buddy character)
 - The branching narrative

For example, how would players respond to the following versions of the game?

 - Dask is still nudging the player, but there is no narrative
 - There is a narrative, but the information is presented without Dask providing it
 - It is merely an interactive textbook where you can jump around
 - It is merely a very large block of text
