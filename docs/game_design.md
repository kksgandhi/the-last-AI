The game begins as Dask explains that you are an AI designed to guide and protect humanity. Dask explains that, in order to fulfill your mission, you must first understand philosophy; you will be forced to make difficult decisions as protector of humanity, and philosophy will help you in your path. As the game continues, Dask explains simple theories of normative ethics and challenges the players views. Alongside Dask is another NPC named Inim, who plays a smaller role. Inim is more confrontational, abrasive, and casual.

 - Why AI?
   - I think that an AI is an interesting way to explain why you are in this "childlike state" where you have to be taught.
 - Why "guiding and protecting the world"?
   - "Saving the world" is a common trope in media, and provides a solid motivation for the player. In other words, it explains why the player has to learn philosophy at all.
 - Why have Dask?
   - In my opinion, philosophy is best taught through Socratic dialogue. Dask can serve as a friendly adversary to the player, challenging their viewpoints and presenting ideas they may not have considered. Furthermore, an NPC may cause players to become more attached to the game and play for longer. (e.g. I could see players trying to "outsmart" Dask)
 - Why have Inim?
   - Inim, being more confrontational, can critique the player's choices in a way that would be out of character for Dask. Furthermore, switching dialogue between Dask and Inim provides variety in tone. Finally, technical and jargon rich sections can be voiced by Dask, while more casual sections can be voiced by Inim.

In a normal playthrough of the game, the player won't see all of the content. In fact, the game is split between Utilitarianism and Deontology, and most players will only see one track which means they will miss half of the content. This was intentional, I wanted the game to feel as though it was responding to your philosophical views instead of just throwing everything in philosophy at you. I imagine that curious players would use the restart button regardless and see most of the content.
