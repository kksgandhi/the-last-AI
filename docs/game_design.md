The game begins as Dask explains that you are an AI designed to guide and protect humanity. Dask explains that, in order to fulfill your mission, you must first understand philosophy. You will be forced to make difficult decisions as protector of humanity, and philosophy will help you in your path. As the game continues, Dask explains simple theories of normative ethics

 - Why AI?
   - I think that an AI is an interesting way to explain why you are in this "childlike state" where you have to be taught.
 - Why "guiding and protecting the world"?
   - "Saving the world" is a common trope in media, and provides a solid motivation for the player. In other words, it explains why the player has to learn philosophy at all.
 - Why Dask?
   - In my opinion, philosophy is best taught through Socratic dialogue. Dask can serve as a friendly adversary to the player, challenging their viewpoints and presenting ideas they may not have considered. Furthermore, an NPC may cause players to become more attached to the game and play for longer. (e.g. I could see players trying to "outsmart" Dask)
