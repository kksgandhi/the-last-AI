A well designed transformational game meshes story and gameplay. The story for this game is that you are an AI who is destined to rule the world, but in order to do that, you must first learn philosophy.

 - Is this story sufficient to motivate the player to learn philosophy?
 - Is this story sufficiently set up and reinforced in the game?
