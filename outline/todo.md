General Todo
------------

 - Add deont to George link
 - Rethink post trolley, pre division
 - Ends justify the means instead of doing good
 - Make deontology more dynamic
 - Add some deontological conflicts (revisit the trolley problem)
 - talk about how there are other branches of philosophy
 - Add a way to switch between deont track and util track
 - modify convos based on if they've picked certain things before.

Someday
---------

 - Discussions of ethical community could be part of both
 - Euthyphro dilemma
 - If they didn't see the first "why philosophy", add another one
 - Work on "more probabalism"

Deontology
----------

 - Killing vs Letting Die
 - How do we make these principles
 - What do do when principles conflict
 - Does this tell us *what* to believe, or merely is a frame to build around.

 - Prima Facie Duty
 - The Human Formulation
 - The Categorical Imperative
 - Virtue Ethics
 - Social Contractualism?
 - Ethical Egoism?
 
Let's go through these concepts and have Inim tear each one of them down... then talk about Deontology in general

Add "Actually, I think collapse is reasonable"

I kinda want to talk about the DDE somewhere, but not sure exactly where... (ok nevermind if I readd the trolley problem post deont it should work)

Utilitarianism
--------------
 
  - What is good?
  - Utility fonts / utility sink
    - Souperogative?
  - Probabilism?

Questions
---------

 - How do we allow for moments of self reflection / slow the player down?
 - How to go deeper into philosophy without going insane?

Housekeeping
------------

 - Dask shouldn't use contractions, Inim should
 - Change post trolley rationalizing, maybe remove entirely
 - No humans were harmed in the making of this *game*??
