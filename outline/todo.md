General Todo
------------

 - Add some deontological conflicts (revisit the trolley problem)
 - talk about how there are other branches of philosophy

Dynamic Tracks
--------------

Someday
-------

 - Discussions of ethical community could be part of both
 - Euthyphro dilemma
 - If they didn't see the first "why philosophy", add another one
 - Work on "more probabalism"

Deontology
----------

 - Virtue Ethics
 - Social Contractualism?
 - Ethical Egoism?
 
I kinda want to talk about the DDE somewhere, but not sure exactly where... (ok nevermind if I readd the trolley problem post deont it should work)

Utilitarianism
--------------
 
  - What is good? (Perhaps mix with discussions of the moral community)
  - Utility fonts / utility sink
    - Souperogative?
  - Probabilism?

Questions
---------

 - How do we allow for moments of self reflection / slow the player down?
 - How to go deeper into philosophy without going insane?

Housekeeping
------------

 - Dask shouldn't use contractions, Inim should
