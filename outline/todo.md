General Todo
------------

 - Add utilitarian trolley problems, ask if it makes the player feel uncomfortable.
 - Add some deontological conflicts
 - Add a way to switch between deont track and util track
 - modify convos based on if they've picked certain things before.

Someday
-------

 - Euthyphro dilemma
 - If they didn't see the first "why philosophy, add another one"
 - Work on "more probabalism"

Problems for Deont:
-------------------

 - Killing vs Letting Die
 - How do we make these principles
 - What do do when principles conflict
 - Does this tell us *what* to believe, or merely is a frame to build around.
 
Problems for Utilitarian
------------------------
 
  - Fat Man & Surgeon problems
  - How do we define the moral community?
  - What is good?
  - Utility fonts / utility sink
  - Probabilism?

Questions
---------

How do we allow for moments of self reflection / slow the player down.

Housekeeping
------------

 - Dask shouldn't use contractions, Inim should
 - Change post trolley rationalizing, maybe remove entirely
 - No humans were harmed in the making of this *game*??
